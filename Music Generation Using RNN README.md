# Deep-Learning-Projects
The core of this project is a deep learning model that uses RNNs, a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or music. We’ve trained our model on a large dataset of sheet music in ABC notation, a text-based format for music notation.

Our model is a “character RNN”, which predicts the next character in a sequence. In the context of our project, the “characters” are musical notes, and the “sequences” are snippets of music. After training, our model can generate new sequences of music, note by note, that mimic the patterns it learned from the training data.

Key Features
Music Generation: Our model can generate a brand new piece of music that’s never been heard before! Just run the model, and it will output a sequence of notes in ABC notation. You can then convert this ABC text into sheet music or even a MIDI file to listen to the result.
Customizable Output: You can control how long the generated piece of music is, and you can seed the generation process with a start string to influence the style of the output.
Deep Learning Techniques: This project provides a hands-on example of working with RNNs, a powerful type of machine learning model that’s especially good at handling sequence data.
