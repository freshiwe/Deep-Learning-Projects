Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN
This repository contains code and instructions for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Overview
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 small square grayscale images of handwritten single digits (0 to 9). The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the digit represented by a given image.
